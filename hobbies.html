                        <h4>Chasing Rainbows</h4>
                        <p>So I like to pack my kids in the car and drive in
                            the direction of the rainbow when we get them. 
                            Sometimes with hot cocoa.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The Perfect Sunset</h4>
                        <p>I also like sitting in the car or outside of it
                            and look at the sunset, sometimes we have pretty good ones
                            but the best ones I've seen were on the beaches of South America.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Of Course Coffee</h4>
                        <p>Some people might consider a problem, but my love (or addiction) for 
                            this beverage is stronger than the nay sayers. You will likely
                            ALWAYS find with a cup of it near. Night time is for decaf. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>My Bipolar Cat</h4>
                        <p>She was never particularly friendly, but as she gets up in her years
                            she is getting weird. Doesn't stop me from buying her treats 
                            she's too cool to eat, beds that are apparently not up to her expectations, 
                            and toys that somehow she ALWAYS manages to lose.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>HALLOWEEN</h4>
                        <p>I love anything to do with halloween! not as much as I love coffee, but it's 
                            a close second. When summer ends, and the weather turns cold it's time to get 
                            SPOOKY! and there are few things that are better.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>My family</h4>
                        <p>Yep. I'm a home buddy. I love to make popcorn and put on a movie that came out 
                            when I was a kid, with my kids next to me. One of their favorites is "My neighbor Totoro"
                            If not that, probably sitting on my front porch watching play outside with co... some beverage at hand.
                        </p>
