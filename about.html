            <p>What did Mommy spider say to Baby spider?
                “You spend too much time on the web.”</p>
            <p2>Hi Ya'll! As you probably saw from my home page I am "Mom" to two little ones (three if you count my partner). 
                I consider myself a Michelin chef only because my kids has yet to say yuck to my food. Top in the league for games,
                board and card games that is. I love the sound of silence and the clickety clack of my keyboard when I code "Hello, World"
                or attempt to fix that "bug". 
            </p2>
            <p3>
                Honestly, I am new to it all. I don't have the answers to mommy life or even that broken code. But like all other 
                folks, I'm just doing it (Nike please dont sue me!!). I really do enjoy a nice home cooked meal, love hiking new places,
                board games, Disney/Pixar movies, and most of all doing it with my family. Through all of this, I have found the love for 
                coding and showing my girls what Womxn can do with some hard work and carpel tunnel. I hope you get the opportunity to 
                understand me through my page. 
            </p3>
            <p4>Love Always,</p4>
            <p5>Mai Truong</p5>
