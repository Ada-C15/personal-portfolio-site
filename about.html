            <h1>About Glenda</h1>
            <p class="about-p">
                My name is Glenda Chicas, my pronouns are she/her, and Iâ€™m excited to begin a software developer internship through Ada Developers Academy. 
                I am originally from El Salvador and came to America at the age of 13. I am fluent in both Spansih and English. Before Ada, 
                I was working as a patient care coordinator (PCC) at UW Medicine which involved organizing outpatient care by scheduling surgeries, admissions, 
                diagnostic procedures, and/or coordinating requests for consultation among other medical specialties. I began my coding journey about 2 years ago. 
                I started by studying on the Free Code camp website. I was thrilled to see all the things I was able to create even though they were just small projects. 
                Continuing my education has been a goal that I have always wanted to pursue. I'm excited to bring my passion and creative problem solving skills to my new team. 
                I have experience working in large diverse teams and I have excellent communication skills. During and after my internship, I hope to continue my learning 
                and support other women and gender-diverse people in tech.
