            Hi I'm Sneha! I am a budding software engineer and I am currently learning at ADA DEVELOPERS ACADEMY. 
            I hold a Doctrate degree in Tissue Engineering but I have been drawn towards Computer Engineering for a long 
            time and it seemed like the right time to pursue this dream with the help and support of ADA. I feel fortunate to 
            have amazing peers and instructors who selflessly and tirelessly strive to help, encourage and support every student. Truly grateful for
            this experience. I am excited to show you what I have learned in the past few months!
            </p>
