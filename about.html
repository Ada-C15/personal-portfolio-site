                <h2>HALISA SAIPULLA</h2>
                <h3>Full Stack Development Student at Ada Developer Academy </h3>
                <p>
                    <br>Hello! My name is Halisai Saipulamu, my pronouns are she/her, and I’m excited to begin a software developer internship through Ada Developers Academy. Before delving into coding I studied chemical engineering at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and energy and nuclear engineering at the Polytechnic University of Turin .
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    <br>My chemistry background developed my curiosity to unknown challenges, which improved my critical thinking and creativity. I also have retail experiences which gave me the opportunity to collaborate with excellent team members and enhance customer facing effective communication skills. When I moved to the United States four years ago, I was exposed to coding for the very first time by my coworker. The sense of accomplishment, the thrill of managing my technical expertise to create a product from scratch and the excitement of seeing my potential appealed to me, which convinced me to start my programming journey.
                </p>  
                <p>   
                    <br>I’m proud to be the first Uyghur to be part of the Ada community, and got the chance to pursue my dream. I look forward to applying my tech proficiency to make the tech accessible to more underrepresented communities and empower them to accomplish more.
