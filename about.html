                    Hi, my name is Heidi C. Zhang (She/Her), welcome to my homepage!  
                    <br><br>Before starting my journey in tech, I was in the finance industry, managing Energy Companies’ financial needs and relationships in Houston, TX.
                    <br><br>My favorite things since I’ve started programming are creating things from scratch and using technology to help and teach others!
                    <br><br>In my spare time, I always try to enjoy the company of friends, laughter, fresh air, good food and lots of coffee and tea.
                    <br><br>If you are in the Bay area and would like a coffee buddy, reach out!
                </p>
