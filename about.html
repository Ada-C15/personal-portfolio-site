                an emergency physician. Her family has Danish, German and Polish ancestry. She has three sisters. She
                moved to St. Louis with her family in 1994. In 2013, the family moved to Goshen, New York to support her
                modeling career. Kloss has called her classical ballet training "a beautiful thing" that taught her how
                to move in the modeling world and was a great training ground for her runway walk.
                In 2011, Kloss graduated from Webster Groves High School in Webster Groves, Missouri, where she was a
                cheerleader. In September 2015, Kloss enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study of New
