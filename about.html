      <p>
        My name is Brittany (she/her) and I'm a current software
        development student at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. Before
        delving into coding I was a Patient Service Specialist at Harborview
        Medical Center. While working at a hospital I challenged myself by
        learning medical terminology. This was exciting because it gave me the
        chance to be more efficient at communicating with medical professionals.
        Work experience taught me that learning new skills and problem solving
        regularly is what I enjoy. When I discovered programming I was excited
        again - I could be constantly challenged while making a positive impact
        to my clients' business.
        
        I am detail-oriented and analytical from my medical background, and from
        my patient service specialist position I have gained immense empathy for
        the people around me and stellar communication skills! I'm looking
        forward to putting all of these skills together. I am extremely excited
        to begin an internship as a software developer. I cannot wait to
        exercise all the skills I've gained at Ada as well as learn new skills
        that will take me to a full-time position. During and after my
        internship, I hope to continue learning and to support other women and
        gender-diverse people in tech.
