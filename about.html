            <p> Hi I'm Sneha! I am a software engineer and I am currently learning at ADA DEVELOPERS ACADEMY. I hold a Doctrate degree in Tissue Engineering but I have been drawn towards Computer Engineering for a long 
            time and it seemed like the right time to pursue this dream with the help and support of ADA. I feel fortunate to have amazing peers and instructors who selflessly and tirelessly strive to help, encourage and support every student. 
            Truly grateful for this experience. I am excited to show you what I have learned in the past few months!</p>
