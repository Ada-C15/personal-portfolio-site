        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
          Hi I'm Sneha! I am a software engineer and I am currently learning at
          Ada developers academy. I hold a Doctrate degree in Tissue Engineering
          but I have been drawn towards Computer Engineering for a long time and
          it seemed like the right time to pursue this dream with the help and
          support of ADA. I feel fortunate to have amazing peers and instructors
          who selflessly and tirelessly strive to help, encourage and support
          every student. Truly grateful for this experience. I am excited to
          show you what I have learned in the past few months!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My interest in coding started during a biotech project management
          course that I took, where I developed a keen interest in learning
          programing languages for data management and took an initiative to
          self-learn Python via online learning platforms. During my doctorate
          studies, I gained extensive experience in lab research, critical
          thinking and problem-solving skills, and attention to details. As a
          full-time deputy senior warden at the university halls of
          accommodation, I developed strong interpersonal skills and experienced
          inclusivity and strength in diversity as I worked with staff and
          students from all across the globe. I have performed in leadership
          roles at my previous job (Datar Genetics, India) as a lead scientist
          where I played a key role in delivering the project goals before the
          predicted deadline. I have quickly learnt new technical skills,
          demonstrated good team building skills, solid time management, and
          excelled within a fast-paced start-up environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am always looking for a challenge and an opportunity to creatively
          solve complex real-world problems.
