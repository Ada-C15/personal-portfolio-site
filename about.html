            Marisa is Seattle native and former Social Justice Educator with 10+ years of 
            teaching and facilitation experience, looking to leverage their leadership, 
            resilience and creativity as a full stack developer.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Before applying to Ada, Marisa taught pretty much everything; from swimming and sewing,
            to 7 years as a social justice centered elementary teacher. She loved the creative challenge 
            of teaching, but found herself frustrated by the instability. The annual rotation of school 
            leadership and teaching staff, not to mention deep seeded structures of oppression inherent in 
            education, undermined her efforts to enact lasting change and stability her students 
            desperately needed. The programmers in Marisa’s life tempted her to join them with the idea 
            of developing products that schools, businesses, <em>everyone</em>, could rely on for more than 
            9 months.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through Ada Developers Academy, Marisa discovered the thrill and joy of developing clean, 
            creative code solutions in the company of other brillant aspiring programmers. 
            They continue to utilize their facilitation and organizing experience. So far they have 
            organized a regular study group, as well as Gaydies: a group for queer identified Ada 
            students to connect and support one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marisa looks forward to continuing to expand their technical and practical knowledge 
            as well as organizing space for marginalized communities in tech.
