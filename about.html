                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>I decided to pursue my Bachelor’s in Instructional Education, and prior to Ada, I worked at a B2B SaaS company as a Product Operations Manager to expand into EMEA, and APAC countries.</p>
                  <p>While working as a liaison between the developers, business partners, and end users, I realized that I enjoyed technical topics more, so I decided to revive my childhood dream and pick up coding once again. Now here I am, a proud student of Ada Developers Academy.</p>
                  <p>In addition to what I’m learning at Ada, my prior job experience with security and product API’s, which heavily utilized research, experimentation and data analytics have positively impacted my learnings, and I hope to expand on my knowledge during internship, as I get the opportunity to explore both the back and front end to more deeply discover where my skills and interests align.</p>
