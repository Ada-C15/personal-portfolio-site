                Hello! My name is Erika Chikere and I use (she/her) pronouns. Before embarking on my coding journey, I had the wonderful opportunity of working as a Global HR Manager. In my role, I assisted hundreds of employees across the globe with career planning, total compensation and health benefits.  This hands-on experience allowed me to witness first-hand the intersection between technology and business. 
                </p>
                <p>
                
                Growing up, I have always enjoyed re-orienting my brain with the ‘mind’ of the computer to visualize how data is stored and modified to create modern technology. I also care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I am enthusiastic and ready to gain practical experience in a software engineering internship. I believe that my insatiable appetite to learn and grow will  enable me to make an impact. 
                
                    </p>
