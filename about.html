                I am mexican by birth, american by choice and mom by luck.<br><br>
                Most of my experience has been in the Aviation Industry, where I earned experience doing design, implementation and testing to certify the Controls Logics for the Boeing 787 (GEnx-1B) aircraft engine.<br><br>
                During my time at GE Aviation, I learned important skills like complex problem solving, detail oriented, teamwork, project management, and to deliver success to customers after understanding their needs.

                As a mom, I have managed to keep organized enough to continue learning new skills like programming. For me, programming has always been something exciting. It is like a mental challenge and I love it because of that.<br><br>
                Before joining ADA, I took the initiative to learn C#, HTML and CSS basics by my own. I completed the learning path <a class="special-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-software-developer">“Become a Software Developer”</a> in LinkedIn Learning. After that, I was able to code personal projects from scratch to apply the knowledge that I learned, which has been a big personal milestone in my journey to become a Software Developer. You can find these projects in the <a class="special-link" href="./portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section.<br><br>
                Now, I am a Software Developer student at <a class="special-link" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">ADA Deveopers Academy</a>. I have been so lucky to have the opportunity to continue learning from different wonderful instructors. I am beyond grateful to be part of this incredible organization that has empowered me with knowledge to achieve my dream to become a Software Developer.<br><br>
