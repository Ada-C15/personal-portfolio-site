                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, but I currently live in Seattle, Washington. I moved to Seattle for the Ada Developers Academey program to make it easier when internships begin and for after it ends. So far I'm loving this prgram and I really like the challenging assignments. It honestly reminds me of my science teacher in elementary school who was the first one to give me challenging problems and help me find my love for math and science. Thanks to her, her influence is what made me want to be an engineer and helped me grow by making me compete in science competitions. Every year she made do a completely different design or topic than what I did in previous years to show me that there are unlimited ways to solve problems. At first she only had me sign up for egg drop competitions. Then once I got first place in that the next year she added toothpick bridges, rubberband airplanes, mouse trap cars, then lastly the science fair. Each year she added one of those competitions onto what I did the year before, but she constantly made sure that it was something I wanted and that I wasn't overwhelmed. The instructors in this program remind of me of her with their kindness and drive to make us stronger people and developers.

                <h2>My Family</h2>
                <p>
                    An interesting fact about my family is that all of our names start with D and everyone's first names are 5 letters long, except me. I'm the oldest of three and my siblings and I are 2 years apart. My mom, sister and my birthday are exactly a week apart from each other, so my sister and I sometimes shared our birthdays together when we were young. We are a very close family and my siblings and I get along very well especially that we're older. If you like astrology my mom, sister, and I are Aquarius' ♒️ (I'm the only February Aquarius, if there's a difference), my dad is a Pisces ♓️ and my brother is a Gemini ♊️.

                <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    I absolutely love playing video games especially with my siblings because that's one of our ways of bonding. My favorite games are Persona5 and the Assassins Creed series, I average over 120 hours for each of those games. If I hadn't been watching anime I would have never found out about the Persona5 series or found new foods to try (from Food Wars). I am forever grateful to the International students from my high school for introducing me to anime because that has also lead to some of the greatest friends I've have. Thanks to one of my friends, who I usually talk about anime with, he has recently got me to read manga and I had forgotten how much I loved reading. So now some of the anime shows I've watched I have picked up where they left of in the manga and usually read the newest chapter over the weekend (if it's uploaded). On the hobbies page I'll have some of the recipes that I've used and loved with my own changes to them.
