                        Hello! My name is Hena and I am pursuing software development through Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. Prior to finding my passion for programming, I have worked in various different industries, including customer service, skincare, medical, and legal fields. As a result of performing a wide range of tasks in a broad range of roles, I have established principles that have shaped the way I take ownership of my projects along the way. My exposure to different environments has also led me to discover areas in which I thrive most, ones that consistently provide intellectual nourishment and fuel my drive to evolve.<br><br>

                        I am proud to be a life-long student and consider programming to be the gateway to infinite learning opportunities. It has sparked in me a deep interest for world-changing technologies, such as Autonomous Things (AuT), blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency. It has also introduced me to like-minded individuals at Ada, my instructors and peers who have shown me the value of being radically transparent and never failing to advocate for each other. I cannot wait to embark on my internship to pay it forward, share my unique perspective and experiences, and create meaningful changes with my future team!</p>
