            More about me
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>I live in Seattle, Washington, where I enjoy climbing on basalt, granite, limestone, and more.
                The different rock types are, of course, reminiscent of the variety in coding languages. Some
                are stickier than others, some break with no warning, and some demand that you wedge your way into the cracks
                in order to make any progress at all. </p>
            <p>I spent a lot of years shaking cocktails and polishing silverware before I pursued a career in hospitality leadership.
                After six meaningful careers as a leader in the industry, Covid gave me the boot and I embraced
                that as my opportunity to type real fast for a living. I gotta say, I like it here.  </p>
            <p>I value my time with my really cool and hot wife. I'd almost always rather be camping & climbing. 
                I am always on time, deliver on my promises, and I always make sure my guest gets the best seat at the table.
