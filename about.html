        <h2>About!</h2>

        <p>Hello! In the couple years after I graduated from the University of Rochester with a BA in Economics, I lived in Brooklyn. I found myself pursuing my own small ventures: NPO’s and startup ideas, because I always had a business acumen and wanted to start something that could directly impact and help people. I felt lost at times, and so I first crossed paths with programming through my partner Jacob (a software engineer), who taught me my first lines of code. He passed away from an accident in 2019. I finished my first online programming course a bit after that.
        </p>

        <p>The past few years were the catalyst for my realization that I don’t always need to be building something impactful in my career to have an impact on people. The personal relationships I have with others are impactful, and make me happy.</p>

        <p>But life is all about balance, and I’m grateful to have landed in a profession that allows for this seemingly perfect balance: a stability in a career so I can pursue any newfound happinesses, and still - the ability to build and contribute in a team that makes a direct impact through the code that we write. I’ve been problem solving, learning, and growing all my life, and I can’t wait to start doing so as an intern!</p>
