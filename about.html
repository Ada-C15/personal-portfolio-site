        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I am mexican by birth, american by choice and mom by luck.</p>
            Electronics Engineer who is eager to return to the work force after caregiving for my loved ones.</p>
        <p>I am a results-driven engineer with 5 years of experience in the Aviation Industry doing design, implementation and testing to certify
        the Controls Logics Software for the Boeing 787 aircraft engine. During my time at GE, I learned to deliver success to customers after
        understanding their needs.</p>
        <p>I was focused on ensuring that the engine performance met the customer's requirements.  Had constant communication with customers 
        throughout the whole development process to ensure the Controls logics perform efficiently and behave according to the requirements. Aslo, 
        had collaboration and communication with other teams out of my area by using a version control software (Synergy), to integrate and 
        resolve conflicts correctly in each software version.</p> 
        <p>I also earned experience doing project planning, task estimations, tracking projects and negotiations with my customers (Boeing).</p>
        <p>As a mom, I have managed to keep organized enough to continue learning new skills like programming. For me, programming has always 
        been something exciting. It is like a mental challenge and I love it because of that. Before joining ADA, I took the initiative to 
        learn C#, HTML and CSS basis by my own. I completed the learning path of “Become a Software Developer” in LinkedIn Learning. After that
        I was able to code personal projects from scratch to apply the knowledge that I learned, which has been a big personal milestone in 
        my journey to become a Software Developer. You can find these projects in the PROJECTS section.</p>
        <p>Now, at ADA I have been so lucky to have the opportonuty to learn from a lot of grat instructors, who are full </p>
