        <p>ABOUT ME</p>
        <p>
          Hi I'm Sneha! I am a software engineer and I am currently learning at
          Ada developers academy. I hold a Doctrate degree in Tissue Engineering
          but I have been drawn towards Computer Engineering for a long time and
          it seemed like the right time to pursue this dream with the help and
          support of ADA. I feel fortunate to have amazing peers and instructors
          who selflessly and tirelessly strive to help, encourage and support
          every student. Truly grateful for this experience. I am excited to
          show you what I have learned in the past few months!
