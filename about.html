                My name is Leilani Allen, my pronouns are She|Her, and I am excited to begin my software development
                internship
                through Ada Developers Academy. I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, and love living in the
                PNW. Before
                Ada, I spent most of my career working in healthcare. It was there I found my love for data analytics,
                mentoring, and problem solving. I began my coding journey in 2020 when I felt a craving to learn a new
                skill. I
                did many self learning tutorials on various websites and looked for free resources wherever I could. I
                want to
                be able to work in a field that is going to continue to challenge me year after year and expand my
                knowlege
                beyond what I thought I was capable of. During my internship I am look forward to applying my new skills
                in the
                industry and gaining more experience. I hope to continue my learning and personal growth while
                supporting my
                fellow peers to achieve their goals.
