                        Hi, my name is Jennifer Lim (she/her) and I am a software engineering student at Ada Developers Academy. I came into software development from a non-traditional pathway as a stay-at-home mom of two wonderful kids, and as a Brazillian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) competitor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™ve always had a deep desire to understand how software is designed and built. I taught myself how to code through online resources, and I fell in love with the process of designing, solving problems, and creating features. This arduous and exciting learning journey has made me realize that I, with a growth mindset and grit, can learn and achieve anything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my software development journey, my experiences as a mom and as a BJJ practitioner have added great value to my process. I have led and managed the operations and infrastructure of my household, while raising two kids (one with special needs). In addition, my BJJ training empowered me to learn new concepts quickly, collaborate well with others, and calmly solve problems under dynamic and stressful conditions.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ada saw these experiences as strengths and has enabled me to materialize my dream of becoming a professional software engineer. I am thrilled and grateful to be a part of this incredible organization. I will continue their mission by advocating and being a resource to other underrepresented groups in the tech industry.
                    </p>
