            <p>________________________________________</p>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to attending Ada Developers Academy, I was a clinical research coordinator at the Kidney Research Institute.  My experience in Public Health research and programs has honed my analytical skills, passion for iterative improvement, and empathic communication. I am confident that my unique combination of strengths will allow me to drive meaningful, technological innovations with people at the core of what I build.</p>
            <p>Before committing to a Masters, I took a step back to reassess the ways in which I wanted to grow, as well as what work was important to me. During this time, I found programming. Wanting to apply my learning, I asked a friend if I could make a website for her budding baking business. This endeavor catapulted my interest in software development. I found that I was engrossed in exploring solutions, fascinated by the artistry of programming, and eager to learn new techniques. I am incredibly excited to pursue a career in Tech, to collaborate on tools and resources that have the capacity to enrich the lives of so many others.</p>
