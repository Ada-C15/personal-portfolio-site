                Hello all! My name is Maite Arp (she/her) and I never really know what to say about me. Coming up with things that don't sound like I 
                just learned to write last week is  hard. I guess, I'll start at the VERY beginning. I was born in South America (Lima - Peru), way back in the 
                late 80's, when big hair was a thing and the internet was not. During my early years computers were something I saw once or twice 
                a week while in school. So not too new, but not exactly familiar. Life went on and in 2004 my family migrated to the US. Once 
                here I we settled in North Idaho were I had to promptly learn to speak English, as the end of high school was coming ever closer. 
                I graduated high school and went on to college from which I graduated in 2011 with a degree in psychology. My husband and I moved 
                to the Seattle area the year prior and have been local ever since.<br>
                I worked a variety of administrative roles before taking a step back to raise a family. I began my coding journey a few years ago in a 
                full day class that taught basic HTML and CSS. It was there that I discovered my passion for seeing my ideas come to life on a computer 
                screen. Since then, I practiced my skills in my spare time and completed classes on introductory JavaScript and SQL, which made me 
                realize this is the right path for me. 
                Before beginning my journey at Ada Developers academy, I was a stay at home mom. While I treasure the time I got to spend with my family, 
                I am ready to step back into the job market. I look forward to bringing my experience, time management, problem solving ability, and 
                creativity to my new career.
