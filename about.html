        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Gloria Villa (she/her). I graduated from Pomona college with a degree in Sociology and Public Policy. I am proficient in Spanish. To improve my Spanish technical vocabulary I have started to attend a Mexico data tool meetup.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am pursuing a career in software development because I enjoy making improvements in systems and want to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable with technology. I feel I can provide a unique perspective to technology teams as a woman and person of color. I am interested in further exploring Voice, Mobile, Tool Development and AI/Machine Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my hobbies include paddleboarding, hiking, traveling, volunteering, reading and playing pool. Captaining and co-captaining pool teams for over 10 years, I have learned to effectively coach, balance team dynamics, and plan fun events for teammates to get to know each other outside of work. I look forward to participating in hackathons because I think they provide the teamwork aspects I enjoy from team pool tournaments. I look forward to hearing more about your team and how I can contribute.
