        <h2>About me: </h2>
        My name is Leilani Allen, my pronouns are She|Her, and I am excited to begin my software development internship through Ada Developers Academy. I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, and love living in the PNW. Before Ada, I spent most of my career working in healthcare. It was there I found my love for data analytics, mentoring, and problem solving. I began my coding journey in 2020 when I felt a craving to learn a new skill. I did many self learning tutorials on various websites and looked for free resources wherever I could. I want to be able to work in a field that is going to continue to challenge me year after year and expand my knowlege beyond what I thought I was capable of. During my internship I am look forward to applying my new skills in the industry and gaining more experience. I hope to continue my learning and personal growth while supporting my fellow peers to achieve their goals.</p>
