                    <h3>Software developer in training...</h3>
                    <p>I am currently a software development student at Ada Developer’s Academy in Seattle, WA.</p>
                    <p>Prior to studying at Ada, I was an Assistant Buyer at Sur La Table where I was responsible for managing the Electrics and Food business. As an assistant buyer, I worked closely with vendors (Breville, KitchenAid, DeLonghi, Nespresso) to negotiate costing, promotions, new product launches and marketing funds. I was also responsible for analyzing large data sets and creating pivot tables to track sales and present them in monthly Open to Buy meetings with Merchandising and Planning executives. In addition to being a merchant prior to Ada, I created and founded my baking company, Whisk Baking Company in April 2018. It was through my baking company that I jumped into coding; through numerous Youtube videos and lots of Google-ing, I learned HTML and CSS to design my website for my baking business. </p>
                    <p>Taking on the challenge of teaching myself coding with the goal of improving my business is something that I am immensely grateful for. Learning HTML and CSS reminded me that I enjoy learning new skills and crave being constantly challenged. </p>
                    <p>As a student at Ada, I am interested in learning more about iOS engineering and working with a products and applications that are used on Apple’s plethora of devices. I am specifically interested in Apple iOS because Apple’s technology is constantly changing and evolving, working on a project that has to adapt to Apple’s applications would be a constant, yet exhilarating challenge. </p>
