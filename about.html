        <h2>hey there! my name is lindsey lee (she / her)</h2>
            <p>
            I'm a current software development student at Ada Developer's Academy in Seattle, WA. <br>
            Before delving into coding I was a Supervisor for strategy, partnerships, and social <br>
            for the Bacardi Global account at OMD USA and mentored a diverse cohort of recent grads <br>
            from underserved and underemployed communities transitioning into careers in digital marketing. <br>
            While I loved the challenge of developing business plans and strategies to implement across <br>
            global markets, working together with developers opened my eyes to avenue of opportunities <br>
            through programming. I was introduced to programmimng languages like Python, VBA, and APIs <br>
            to streamline data with programming languages and APIs and make an impact on people's lives.<br>
            <br>I am extremely excited to begin an internship as a software developer. I cannot <br>
            wait to exercise all the skills I've gained at Ada as well as learn new skills that <br>
            will take me to a full-time position. During and after my internship, I hope to continue <br>
            learning and to support other women and gender-diverse people in tech.<br>
            <br> Some of my hobbies include cooking, extreme sports, building IKEA furniture, and <br>
            ignoring the “Are you still watching?” message on Netflix.<br>
