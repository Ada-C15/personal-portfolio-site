                <p>I’m Hannah Lumapas and I am an aspiring software engineer! My interest in coding started in high school when I programmed my TI-84 graphing calculator using draw commands and equations to make graphics. Seeing what I had created sparked my joy in the iterative process of building digital experiences through logic and design. That joy has been a guiding principle during my journey to Ada Developers Academy.</p> 
                <p>Although I didn’t join the tech field right away, my sequence of jobs gave me the diverse skill set to be a great software engineer. I learned to collaborate and operate with empathy while working with patients and doctors as a medical assistant. Then, I learned to have a data-driven approach to problem solving while influencing education policy as an advocate. Most recently as a youth coding instructor, I learned to communicate complex technical concepts to students’ diverse knowledge bases. Between Ada and self-teaching, I am gaining the technical and collaborative skills necessary to be a valued member of the team I join. I am thrilled to be a part of a community of future software engineers who have an equal desire to grow and innovate a more equitable and inclusive tech industry.</p>
