                <h4>Swap Meet</h4>
                <a href="https://github.com/melissa-nguyen/swap-meet">Github: Swap Meet</a>
                <p class="project_description">The goal of this project was to create a virtual swap meet between friends and vendors. I created an event where each ‘friend’ could register as a vendor at Swap Meet and list an inventory of things that they had to ‘swap’. Each friend, could then ‘swap’ items with another friend, only if the product had available inventory, and each friend wanted the product. </p>

                <p class="project_description">The goal of this project was to build a ‘Viewing Party’ program. The Viewing Party contains a list of each friend’s: watched list, favorites list, and watchlist. To determine the best movie to watch, I had to create a series of functions to compare and determine which movies were on each friend’s list and how to recommend movies that were on their ‘favorites’ list but not on their ‘watched list’.</p>

                <p class="project_description">The gal of this project was to create a web API to organize, create, read, update and delete tasks on a to-do list. In addition to this, the API was connected to Slack Bot Messenger; each time a task was successfully completed, a notification message appeared in Slack.</p>

                <p class="project_description">The goal of this project was to create a makeshift Blockbuster (Retro Video Store) API using RESTful methods. The video store contained data about Customers, Videos, videos checked-in, and videos checked-out.</p>

                <p class="project_description">The goal of this project was to build on a previous project, Retro Video Store, and create a fun command line interface. The CLI was interactive and allowed for the user to essentially run the back-end of a retro video store. </p>
