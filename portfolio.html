                        <h3>RETRO VIDEO STORE API</h3>
                        <p> This project was aimed at creating a basic API to keep track of a rental video store. Attached to a postgres database, the API allows the user to add and delete video inventory and customers as well as check videos in and out to customers.</p>

                        <p> Viewing party was one of the first parojects I worked in Python. I used this project to practice fundamentals like nested loops, conditionals, dictionaries and lists. The purpose of Viewing Partyis to make selecting a movie for a viewing party easy! Viewing Party takes in consideration the movies everyone has seen, preferences, and availablity. </p>
