        <h1>Repos</h1>
            <h2><li>Retro Video Store: </li></h2>
            <p>Created a rental system with customized endpoints holding abilities
                such as viewing all customers and / or videos, listing videos checked out to a customer, listing customers who have checked out a video 
                and of course a list of all the videos with the number of inventory.
            </p>

            <h2><li> Task List Api: </li></h2>
            <p>Worked with Flask package for the first time! Created models with conventional RESTful CRUD routes by making a web API to organize our tasks. Applied knowledge about making
                requests in Python, to call an API inside of an API. We also created a one to many relationship between two models. With this we can 
                sort tasks, mark them as complete, get feedback via Slack, and organize tasks with goals.
