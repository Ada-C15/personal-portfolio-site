            Yellow Bike Project (YBP) was started in 1997 and we are a 501c(3) non-profit. Our Mission: Reuse bicycles and to provide tools, workspace, and guidance for all. YBP has many active and past projects aimed at getting people on bikes. Special projects are targeted towards children and those without the means of purchasing bikes. View our Special Projects and Kids’ Programs pages for more details. We also support making the streets of Austin safer.

            Over 100 bicycles have been distributed to kids from underserved communities together through our partner organisations and during our Sunday Spring Kids’ Bike Giveaway. Big thank you to all mechanics who supported us in the last few moths to put those bikes together. We would also like to thank all our donors, thanks to which, we managed to equip the bikes with helmets. We would like to express big gratitude to all of you and each one of you who helped us make this event happen. Bikes have the right to children!
        <p>
            We are now offering both Volunteer Shops and Open/Community Shops both phases of Earn-a-Bike can now be completed. Please review YBP’s Earn-a-Bike form. It explains the program and divides it into two supervised repair checklists: the first performed by E-a-B participants on any bikes YBP plans to donate; the second on the frameset participants earn on the first checklist. You may complete the first checklist at either Volunteer Shops or an Open Shops, And the second checklist at Open Shops. The checklists are self-paced and because the pool of E-a-B framesets come from donations, YBP cannot guarantee that there will be 1) one you like or 2) one that fits you when you’re ready to choose one.
