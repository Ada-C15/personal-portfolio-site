            <h3>Meandering towards the Tech Industry</h3>
            <p>My journey into programming began with my undergraduate thesis on racialized food access. I could have made a more effective case if I’d had programming skills under my belt to create or analyze a database in support of my arguments. I stumbled across online discussions about the ways data science could offer quantitative evidence to back up the lived experiences of black people, to support the Black Lives Matter movement. Seeing the potential that the tech field harbors for advancing solutions to social problems is what made me want to pursue the field. Ultimately, it was a series of tweets that exposed me to the ways programmers can present digital discourse that's as compelling as its historical and anthropological counterparts. The Ada program would be a perfect environment for me to develop my skills to this end. I imagine becoming entrenched in this field, exploring unconventional uses for established technologies. I see myself building programs to monitor food-producing greenhouses in disenfranchised communities. I imagine finally supporting communities directly, giving them back some control, freeing myself and others to meet our needs instead of tangling up in the bureaucracy of entities that have no intention of helping their constituents.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Track of My Intentions</h3>
            <p>I have seen the effect that technological development can have on society when its proponents possess backgrounds that aren’t contextualized by diverse experiences. For example, I have seen data processed narrowly and used to undermine the validity of social justice discourse. Whether it’s acknowledged or not, the tech industry is as vulnerable to bias as any other. Without experiences that drive them to question the status quo or the ways in which they conduct their work, members of the industry often fall prey to blind spots, believing that their processes are infallible or that their conclusions are automatically rigorous. I want to be a software developer because I want to use the skills to support social justice initiatives and influence the industry’s movement away from homogeneity and false rigor. My personal, academic and professional experiences are shaped by a life at multiple intersections; existing at these crossroads has demanded that I develop a unique lens through which to identify opportunities to solve social problems. I want to train at Ada because we agree that well-rounded people create more effective, more resilient solutions to problems. The uniqueness of Ada’s approach to code is also compelling for me. I’ve looked at many bootcamps and worried if the rudimentary curriculum each offered would prepare me for entering the industry. Only Ada commits to situating programming skills within an understanding of computer science principles.</p>
