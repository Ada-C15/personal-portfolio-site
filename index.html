              <p>
                As a herding dog, my arguments are often accused of begging the treat, um, I mean *question*, but these thoughts are not merely circular logic, whether I enjoy making circles or not.  
              </p>
              <p>
                As a working dog, I always say "A good job... is any job." Please give my human something to do. I can only run them on hikes so much, they have way too much energy. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Please feel free to peruse my writings, follow my adventures, or not. You might also find some info about my human's adventure in studying coding, as well. I'm proud of the training I've put into them.
