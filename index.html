        <h1>My Ada Journey Begins</h1>
        <p>
            On July 22, 2020 Ada sent me an invitation to participate in Ada Build for underrepresented minority applicants focusing on Python skills. Little did I know that by accepting that invitation my life would radically change. With  the preparation of Ada Build I was able to confidently complete the coding challenge, the technical and personal interview and get accepted to Ada Academy.  This would not been possible without the amazing support and encouragment from Ada staff, mentors, and my fellow build mates.
