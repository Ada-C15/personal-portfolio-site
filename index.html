                        My name is Daniela Sanchez, my pronouns are she/her. I graduated from the University of Richmond with a degree in Business - Marketing and studies in French and Visual Arts. Prior to enrolling at Ada Developers Academy, I worked in Sales and Marketing in positions where coordinated projects and people, conducted data analysis, and managed content. Most recently, a project I worked on also enabled me to use my skills as a UX designer.

                        My journey into programming began about a year ago when I sought ways to transition into a more project-oriented and technical role. As an artistic person, I started my exploration with Graphic and UX design classes through projects where I first used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I find programming engaging, challenging and very creative. I hope that I use my time with Ada to build on my skills and use my success as a software engineer to pave the way for future latina software engineers.

                        In my free time, I attend to my creative urges by painting, reading, running 5ks, and most recently learning to use a sewing machine. On the weekends I volunteer my time teaching math and reading to kids through an enrichment program.
