            <p>
                My name is Abigail (she/her) and I'm a current software development student at Ada Developer's Academy studying remotely in Los Angeles, CA. Before starting my journey into coding I studied Psychology & Social Behavior and Criminology, Law, and Society at the University of California, Irvine and I also worked as a Research Assistant while in college. After I graduated I worked as a Behavioral Coach at Community West Treatment. While working as a Behavioral Coach I enjoyed working with people and being able to support others. I learned a lot about being an effective communicator while in this role. During my time as a Research Assistant I learned how to be detail oriented when it came to working with and analyzing research data. I also learned interpersonal and communication skills while working with study participants.

            <p>
                I am transitioning into Software Engineering because I want to have a career where I can use my creativity and technical skills to be able to create new things. I love that programming gives me a chance to solve complicated problems with the right research or innovative approach. I am excited to be able to use my creativity and analytical skills during my internship as a software developer. I am also excited to use the skills I am learning at Ada in my internship and in my future career.
