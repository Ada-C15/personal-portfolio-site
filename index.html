            <p class="orange-border">Karlie Elizabeth Kloss (born August 3, 1992) is an American fashion model. Vogue Paris declared her
                one
                of the "top 30 models of the 2000s" when she was 17. Kloss was a Victoria's Secret Angel from 2013
                until
                2015; she resigned to study at New York University. Models.com has said that Kloss "represents the
                gold
                standard of modelingâ€”a girl with the look, the poise, and the drive to take things to the next
                level,"
                and she ranks on their "New Supers" and "Money Girl" lists. By 2019, she had appeared on 40
                international Vogue covers.
                Outside of modeling, Kloss has an interest in technology and has founded the "Kode with Klossy"
                camp,
                which aims to get young girls interested in STEM fields. In 2019, Kloss became the host of the
                reality
                competition television series Project Runway.</p>
