                <h3>06-06-2021: Keeping up with Dinner</h3>
                <p>
                    As a busy mom, we all know the dreadful 5 pm when you are looking frantically in
                    the fridge and pantry to whip something up ðŸ˜±. Over many "I don't care", "I don't know",
                    and "Let's pick something up", I have learned that weekly menus are a savior to 
                    keeping my sanity. There are times where we have to adjust such as impromptu guests 
                    (grandparents ðŸ˜’). But for the most part it works. Every Sunday becomes our ritual 
                    grocery shopping and we plan a weekly dinner that everyone gets to pitch in something
                    they want for the week. Once we get home is where we make our game plan and begin to 
                    portion and marinate. Throughout the week, no asks "What are we having for dinner" or
                    "Can we have pizza?". Answer is "NO! Look at the board."

                <h3>06-07-2021: HTML & CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    em, px, tags, and the list goes on and on. I thought Unit 2: Backend development was 
                    going to be the toughest part of this program, but frontend is just as hardðŸ˜­. Who would 
                    have thought that you would need to be precise when it came to css? Do you remember the
                    days of xanga and mySpace? Why can't my brain function like ye old days. Now I am googling
                    every color, space, font style there is out there. I barely got this h6 to work on this 
                    paragraph that you are reading. Well I guess we will see how brutal JavaScript is. Until
                    next time.
