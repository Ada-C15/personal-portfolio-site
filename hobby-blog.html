                Learning How to Code will Stress you out
            </h2>

            <p>
                When I embarked on my coding journey, I had no clue that learning how to code would drive me crazy. Throughout my academic career, I studied Humanities, Psychology and History. The highest level of math that I took was Calculus. Logic and numbers did not come easy to me. Today, I am shaken but not deterred. You can do this fellow learners.
