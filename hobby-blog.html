                I love cooking and spending time with my family. When I became a mom, I decided to create a motherhood channel in YouTube where I could 
                combine both of these hobbies, cooking and doing STEAM activities with my kids.<br><br>
                This channel has helped me to empower other Latinx moms, and it became a community where we can help each other and feel supported. 
                It has been a pleasure to me and an extremely rewarding commitment to inspire more than 135,000 of other Latinx moms (and dads) over the past five years.<br><br>
                In my journey as a youtuber, I have also enjoyed learning Adobe Premiere, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
