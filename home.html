                My name is Drew and I am a software developer student at the Ada Developers Academy in Cohort 15. If you want to learn more about me then just select the About tab. You can also see some of the projects I've worked on in the Portfolio tab.

                My hobbies include video games, cooking, watching anime, and reading manga. But for this site I'll only have cooking in the hobbies section.

                This is the first website I've ever made and it was a fun experience to do so. If you want to see more select any of the tabs at the top of the page.
